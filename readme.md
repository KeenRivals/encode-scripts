# Encode Script

This is my quick & dirty parallel video encoder. It takes an mkv and dumps out an mp4 and a webm that are ready for use on the web. I don't keep the encoded videos, just the source and the script. I keep them the same  name since I store them all in the same giant directory.

## Usage

Drop the encode script in the same dir as your source file. Rename it to be the same as your source file minus the extension. Run it with PowerShell.

## Requirements

* FFmpeg
* PowerShell
